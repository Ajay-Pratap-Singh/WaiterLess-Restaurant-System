# WaiterLess-Restaurant-System
In the era of digitization, all small and big industries are moving towards automation. Every industry, today, is seeking methods and technology through which they can work efficiently with very less number of men power. As computers are reliable, efficient and come under the categories of one time investment the industries are adopting them right into their core processes.The project ‘Waiter less Restaurant System’ introduces a restaurant which has a very minimal staff, a restaurant in which customer’s orders could reach the kitchen without the aid of waiters. 
In the project java is used in front-end to design a user interface which interacts with MySQL database at back-end.

For the implementation of project, the owner will have to invest four types of
devices –
1. A server where all the data will be stored and all other devices will
communicate with each other through their server.
2. A computer for manager to manage all the processing of the restaurant.
3. Devices on table, these will be used by the customer, to place their order.
4. A device which will be used to flash orders in the kitchen and to take input signal when the order is done.

All four devices will have certain sofware running, so, that they co-ordinate with each other in proper manner. Sofware for manager’s device, for device in kitchen and for customer’s device is designed separately in independent sub projects/modules.

The three folders contain jar file for each of the devices and server will have a mysql database.
