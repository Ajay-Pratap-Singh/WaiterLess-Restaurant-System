# WaiterLess-Restaurant-System
The project ‘Waiter less Restaurant System’ introduces a restaurant which has a very minimal staff, a restaurant in which customer’s orders could reach the kitchen without the aid of waiters. In the project java is used in front-end to design a user interface which interacts with MySQL database at back-end.
